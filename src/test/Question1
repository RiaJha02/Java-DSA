Q1.
The listing on Amazon gives you an array, blocks, that consists of n different weighted blocks, in kg. There are no two blocks with the same weight. The element block[i] denotes the weight of the i-th block from the top of the stack. You consider weight lifting equipment to be good if the block at the top is the lightest and the block at the bottom is the heaviest.

The good weight lifting equipment satisfies the following conditions

blocks[1] < blocks[i] for all 2 <= i <= n
blocks[i] < blocks[n] for all 1 <= i <= n - 1

In one move, you can swap the order of adjacent blocks. Find out the minimum number of moves required to form good weight lifting equipments
