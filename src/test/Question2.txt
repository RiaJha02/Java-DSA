Question 1:
Given A String Containing Integers, A Good String Is One Not Containing A Subsequence (Not Substring)
With The Patterns "010" Or "101".
You Can Perform Operations To Convert 0 To 1 Or 1 To 0.
Return The Number Of Operations Required To Convert A Given String To A Good String

Example: "111101110100"
Answer: 2
We Convert The 0s To 1s In Position 5 And 9
"1111111111100"

Example 2: "0272519360"
Answer: 1
We Convert The 1 To 0 In Index 5, We Get "0272509360"




Question 2:
Given An Array Costs And An Integer K, Your Task Is To Make K Contiguous Partitions To The Costs Array And
Return The Maximum And Minimum Cost After Partition.

Cost Of Partitioning For Index I To J Is Defined As Cost[I] + Cost[J]

Example: Costs= [1,2,3,4] , k=2
Answer : Max = 12
[1+3,4+4] First Partition Is From Index 0 To 2 , second From 3 To 3
Min = 8
[1+1,2+4] First Partition From Index 0 to 0 , second From 1 To 3
